        Welcome! This platform is designed to make your search experience
        seamless with smart voice-activated search and a flexible light/dark
        theme toggle. Whether you’re browsing or hunting for a specific listing,
        these features help you find what you need faster and more comfortably.

        I’m Tanya, a passionate developer who built this app while doing a
        guided project. Along the way, I tackled complex challenges like
        implementing voice search and mastering Tailwind CSS for styling. I’m
        always learning and improving to create better tools for users like you.

        This project wasn’t just about building a real estate platform, it was
        about rebuilding momentum, reigniting curiosity, and proving to myself
        that I’m ready to create again.
