        This real estate web application was built as part of a guided MERN
        stack project from Udemy, but it represents much more than just
        following a tutorial. After taking a year-long break from tech, I used
        this project as a way to reconnect with the tools, concepts, and
        confidence that originally sparked my interest in development.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-slate-700">
        To make it truly my own, I went beyond the course by adding a web
        recognition feature—an enhancement I implemented independently. It was
        both a technical challenge and a reminder of how far I've come. Through
        this process, I revisited core technologies like React, Node.js,
        MongoDB, and Express, and gave myself a hands-on refresher that quickly
        brought everything back under my control.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-slate-700">
        This project wasn’t just about building a real estate platform—it was
        about rebuilding momentum, reigniting curiosity, and proving to myself
        that I’m ready to create again.
